## FAQ

### How to build the app?

All credentials are encrypted so you won't be able to compile the app immediately after a git pull.
You have to replace the files mentioned in [.gitattributes](https://github.com/daohoangson/flutter-tinhte_demo/blob/master/.gitattributes) to build.

For example, `lib/config.encrypted.dart` should look like below:

```dart
import 'package:tinhte_demo/src/config.dart';

class Config extends ConfigBase {
  @override
  final apiRoot = 'https://domain.com/community/api/index.php';

  @override
  final clientId = 'abc';

  @override
  final clientSecret = 'xyz';

  @override
  final siteRoot = 'https://domain.com/community';
}
```
